    <h1 style="color:White; font-family:Courier New;">   This is a minion game that I made with my partner. Essentially you get to choose the fate of the minion. When asked the question "Do you wish minion good luck" you get two choices. If you say yes minion lives another day and gets safely across the road. If you say no minion gets hit by a truck. As an extra bonus option you can input banana, if you do this minion gets distracted and never shows. Minion's fate is in your hands.</h1>

    <h1 style="color:White; font-family:Courier New;">For this project we had to determine where our rover was based off of data from different sensors. My partner Jacob and I decided that it was the Desert Plains. This is because our graphs match the descriptions of the biome as well does our sketched graphs.</h1>

    <h1 style="color:White; font-family:Courier New;">The goal of this project was to analyze a simulation. The simulation that my partner Nealvin and I chose concerned tumors and how they react to chemicals. The simulation starts with a single stem cell, into a cancerous cell then rapidly devloping into a tumor. To add to the simulation there are buttons to kill certain types of cells as well as a graph to track the amount of living cells</h1>

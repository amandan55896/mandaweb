    <h1 style="color:White; font-family:Courier New;">   This is a minion game that I made with my partner. Essentially you get to choose the fate of the minion. When asked the question "Do you wish minion good luck" you get two choices. If you say yes minion lives another day and gets safely across the road. If you say no minion gets hit by a truck. As an extra bonus option you can input banana, if you do this minion gets distracted and never shows. Minion's fate is in your hands.</h1>

    <h1 style="color:White; font-family:Courier New;"> This is a ping pong game I made with my partner Yuki! The game itself is pretty simple and easy to explain. Essentially its a pvp game you can play with your friend and your goal is to score points on your partner while protecting your own goal! </h1>
